# Weekly report 4

## What has happened this week

Implemented my first data structure, NodeList. All algorithms are using it now. 
Tried to implement JPS again, but can't make it work.

## What I've learned

Implementing my mock of ArrayList taught me the basics of doing your own data structure. 

## Next 

Implement simple CLI ui for the program and implement BFS (I know, should have these already). Start implementing necessary
data structures for priority queue and hashset. 


Time used: 4h
