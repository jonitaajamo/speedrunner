# Weekly report 3

## What has happened this week

Implemented Dijsktra and loading map from a file. Researched Jump Point Search and made some testing with it.
Also researched how to implement required data structures.

## What I've learned

Recalled how Dijkstra works and learned about JPS, which is an A* optimization. 

## Next 

Start implementing own data structures and possibly add the JPS, if I get it working.
