# Weekly report 1

## What has happened this week

This week I started the project and at first tried to come up with an idea for the project. 
After I chose the topic, I researched it for a while.

List of stuff I've done:
* Setting up version control
* Initialized gradle project
* Researched the problem

## What I've learned

I've learned how A* is implemented and experimented with it a bit. 
I'm still bit unsure how I proceed with implementing the software itself, 
should I just use CLI at first and maybe graphical one later.

## Next 

I'll start building the application using Java's implementations of the data structures 
and build the basics of importing the .map to two dimensional array and other practical things.


Time used: 5h
