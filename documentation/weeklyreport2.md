# Weekly report 2

## What has happened this week

This week I started implementing the project and made the first implementation of astar with some unit tests. I researhed A* and it's heuristics.
Added checkstyle to the project.  

## What I've learned

I've learned a lot about different heuristics for a star. Also recalled the basics of project structure and testing.

## Next 

Implement other algorithms and import the .map file.
